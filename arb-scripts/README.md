These are scripts for reformatting the ARB output of the Freshwater Training Set

Robin's in the process of pulling them together into a repeatable workflow.
That's gonna be in this repo soon.

The .pl script is the one Trina uses already.
The ones Robin's adding are to address bugs she's encountered while working on 16STaxAss.

When Robin is not writing code, she enjoys referring to herself in the 3rd person.
