The FreshTrain
===

The zipped file in this folder contains the McMahon Lab's custom taxonomy database for lake epilimia, fondly referred to as *The FreshTrain* (for Freshwater Training Set). There are 3 files inside the zipped folder:  

1. The `.taxonomy` file is a table with sequence IDs followed by taxonomic names.   
2. The `.fasta` file lists the nucleotide sequence for each sequence ID.  
3. The readme file describes the changes in the current version of the database.  

The citation for the FreshTrain database is:
