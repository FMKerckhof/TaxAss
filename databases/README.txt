The are the taxonomy databases I use in my taxonomy assignment workflow
	The .taxonomy extension is in a table format, with sequence IDs followed by taxonomic names
	The .fasta extension is the fasta sequence file for each sequence ID


FWonly_7Sept2015.fasta
FWonly_7Sept2015.taxonomy

	These are the two files for the small local database classification.
	They are our freshwater training set, recently updated.
	I got these from Trina in an e-mail 9-7-15 subject "new taxonomy files".


gg_13_5_taxonomy
gg_13_5.fasta

	These are the two files for the large general database classification.
	I downloaded these copies of the Green Genes taxonomy database from their website.
	ftp://greengenes.microbio.me/greengenes_release/gg_13_5/
	on 8-3-25.  checked with md5, not corrupted.
