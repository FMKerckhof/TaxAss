Databases for 16S Taxonomy Assignment Workflow
===

This folder contains the taxonomy databases used for OTU assignment. The `.taxonomy` files contain tables with sequence IDs followed by taxonomic names. The `.fasta` files contain the nucleotide sequence for each sequence ID.

Local Database
---

The local database is the McMahon lab's curated freshwater ARB database. The most recent `.fasta` and `.taxonomy` files from this database are below, though they have not yet been incorporated in the [Freshwater Microbial Field Guide repo](https://github.com/mcmahon-uw/FWMFG).

* FWonly_7Sept2015.fasta
*	FWonly_7Sept2015.taxonomy

These files were sourced form an email from Trina to Robin, dated 2015-09-07 with the subject "new taxonomy files".

Global Database
---

The global database is the May 2013 release of GreenGenes, downloaded from the [GreeenGenes ftp](ftp://greengenes.microbio.me/greengenes_release/gg_13_5/) on 2015-08-03.

* gg_13_5_taxonomy
* gg_13_5.fasta

Because these files are large, they are not stored in this repo.
